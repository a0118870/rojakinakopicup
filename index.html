		Rojak in a Kopi Cup
		<p> The snack dish <em>rojak</em> is a mixture of various ingredients such as taupok, youtiao and a host of other vegetables. However, 'rojak' is sometimes used to describe Singapore culture -- a mixture of various cultural components from other cultures. <em> Rojak in a Kopi Cup</em> thus uses rojak as a means to understand Singapore's culture and what that implies and what implications it has for Singapore.</p>
